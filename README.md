# ModelingS2024
For models constructed in my math modeling class, Spring of 2024. 

Including:
Climate Stability Modeling

"An introduction to the formulation and analysis of mathematical models. This course will present a general framework for the development of discrete and continuous models of diverse phenomena. Principles of modeling will be drawn from multiple areas, such as kinetics, population dynamics, disease spread, traffic flow, particle mechanics, and network science. Mathematical techniques and theory useful for understanding models will be emphasized, such as dimensional analysis, phase plane diagrams, stability analysis, bifurcation theory, conservation laws, random walks, constitutive relations, chaos theory, and computer simulation. A primary goal of this course is to give insights into the connections between mathematics and real-world problems, allowing students to apply the course concepts to applications that excite them."
